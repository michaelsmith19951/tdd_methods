This program uses the three methods of hash.clear, array.first and string.clear. Only the basic functionality of these methods are seen. These methods were also tested with "tdd", to check for failures and passes.

Hash.clear cleans an array (hash) of any contents.

Array.first identifies the first item in an array.

String.clear cleans a string of any contents.
